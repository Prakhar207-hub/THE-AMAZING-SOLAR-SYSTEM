<h1> What is Solar System? </h1>
<body>
<p style ="font-size:25"> The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.<br>
 The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets; two gas giants; and two ice giants. <br></p>
<h2> Planets </h2>
<p style ="font-size:25">A planet is a large celestial body that revolves around the sun in fixed orbits. Planets do not have any light of their own but reflect the light of the sun. <br>
Planets also do not twinkle like stars because they are much closer to us. The earth is also a planet and is the only place we know in the universe to harbour life.</p>
<p style ="font-size:25"> <b> The definition of a planet adopted by the <mark>IAU(The International Astronomical Union) </mark>says a planet must do three things:</b>

1.It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).<br>
2.It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.<br>
3.It must be big enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.<br> </p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg"alt="mercury"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25"> Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System.<br>
 It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to overlapping impact events.<br>
 These features are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere.<br>
 Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth.<br>
 Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.<br> 
Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites. </p>

<p style ="font-size:25"> Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth.<br>
 Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star".<br>
 While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun, appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star.<br>
 With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy. </p>

<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Earth </mark> </b> </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/The_Blue_Marble_%28remastered%29.jpg"alt="earth"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
 This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.<br>
 Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.<br> 
The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere.<br>
 Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.<br>
 Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation. </p>

<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Mars </mark> </b> </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Mars_-_August_30_2021_-_Flickr_-_Kevin_M._Gill.png"alt="mars"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25">Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. <br>
The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".<br>
 Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). <br>
The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere.<br>
 Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, and two irregularly shaped natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. </p>

<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Jupiter </mark> </b> </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Jupiter_New_Horizons.jpg"alt="jupiter"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. <br>
It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.<br>
 Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times.<br>
 It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion. </p>

<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Saturn </mark> </b> </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg"alt="saturn"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.<br>
 It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. <br>
The planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.<br>
 At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.<br>
 Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>

<p style ="font-size:25">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant.<br>
 Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. <br>
The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all the Solar System's planets.<br>
 It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. </p>

<p style ="font-size:25">Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.<br>
 It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.<br>
 Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles).<br>
 It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.</p>
<h3 style ="font-size:30"> Asteroids,Comets & Stars</h3>
<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Asteroids </mark> </b> </p>

<p style ="font-size:25">An asteroid is a minor planet—an object that is neither a true planet nor a comet—that orbits within the inner Solar System. They are rocky, metallic or icy bodies with no atmosphere.<br>
 Sizes and shapes of asteroids vary significantly, ranging from 1-meter rocks to a dwarf planet almost 1000 km in diameter.<br>
Of the roughly one million known asteroids,[1] the greatest number are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, approximately 2 to 4 AU from the Sun, in the main asteroid belt. Asteroids are generally classified to be of three types: C-type, M-type, and S-type.<br>
 These were named after and are generally identified with carbonaceous, metallic, and silicaceous compositions, respectively. The size of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, Ceres, is almost 1,000 km (600 mi) across and qualifies as a dwarf planet.<br>
 The total mass of all the asteroids combined is only 3% that of Earth's Moon. The majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical, stable orbits, revolving in the same direction as the Earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the Sun.</p>

<p style ="font-size:30"> <b> <mark> Comets</mark> </b> </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg"alt="comets"width="500"height="500"> 
<p style ="font-size:25">A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called outgassing.<br>
 This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma.<br>
 These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the outstreaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comet.<br>
 Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles.<br>
 The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. <br>
If sufficiently close and bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and can subtend an arc of up to 30° (60 Moons) across the sky.<br>
 Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.</p>

<p style ="font-size:25">A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.<br>
 Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light.<br>
 The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names.<br>
 Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 10<sup>22</sup> to 10<sup>24 </sup>stars.<br>
 Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye—all within the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<p style ="font-size:25">A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.<br>
 The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.<br>
In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.<br>
 This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.</p>

<p style ="font-size:25">A supernova (pl.: supernovae or supernovas) is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star. A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion.<br>
 The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed to form a diffuse nebula.<br>
 The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.</p>
